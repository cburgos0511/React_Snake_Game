# Title
React Snake Game

# Motivation
This snake game was one of my first react projects if we are not counting, rendering a simple list to the page. I wanted to create something complex but and fun. When I created the project, I had been coding for two months. The biggest challenge of the app was visualizing the snake's movement.  Overall I enjoyed this project and learned a lot about React life cycle events.
